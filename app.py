This application demonstrates a system for predicting machine health and recommending optimal maintenance actions using a hybrid AI model.

**Navigate to the pages in the sidebar to get started:**

- **`Live Dashboard`:** Run a real-time simulation of machine monitoring and see AI-driven recommendations as they happen.
- **`Historical Explorer`:** View and analyze past performance, predictions, and maintenance records for any machine.

This system saves all simulation results to a local database, allowing you to track performance over time.
